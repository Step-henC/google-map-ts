# What is This
Simple Typescript app that uses Google Maps API and Faker JS library to randomly generate coordinates and related business names/catch phrases and user names. Makes
use of interfaces and classes and code reusability. Uses Parcel for compiling and bundling Typescript in JS.

# How To Run
Git clone the project
Create a [google developer console app](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and attach the Map Javascript API service to the newly created app. Then create an access key and insert in index.html src tag. 
In the root project directory, type the command line `npm run dev` and the project will start up at localhost: 1234 in the browser.

# Future Directions
 - Abstract google map api key into dotenv file using [html transformer for parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1209#issuecomment-1383226191)
 - Practice AWS and github actions and deploy app to cloud
